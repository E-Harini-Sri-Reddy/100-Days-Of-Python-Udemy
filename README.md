## 📅 Day 1 - Python Basics & Band Name Generator

### ✅ What I Learned

1. **Printing to the Console**

   - Using the `print()` function
   - Printing strings and combining multiple lines

2. **Taking User Input**

   - Using the `input()` function to capture user input
   - Concatenating input with strings for dynamic messages

3. **String Manipulation**

   - Concatenation: combining strings using `+`
   - Nesting `input()` inside `print()`

4. **Variables**

   - Creating and assigning values to variables
   - Using variables to store user input

5. **Python Variable Naming Rules**
   - Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`)
   - Can contain letters, digits, and underscores
   - Cannot start with a digit
   - Case-sensitive (`name` ≠ `Name`)
   - Cannot use reserved Python keywords (e.g., `if`, `class`, `for`)
